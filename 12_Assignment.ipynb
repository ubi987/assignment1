    "A primary key and a foreign key are two important concepts in relational databases that help establish relationships between tables and ensure data integrity. Let's explain each term:\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each record (row) in that table. Its main purpose is to ensure the uniqueness and integrity of the data within the table. Here are some key points about primary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uniqueness: A primary key must have a unique value for each record in the table. No two records can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Non-nullability: A primary key cannot contain a null value. Every record in the table must have a valid primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stability: A primary key should be stable and not change over time. It provides a reliable way to identify and reference a specific record.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Single value or composite key: A primary key can be a single column or a combination of multiple columns (composite key) that together uniquely identify a record.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Indexing: Primary keys are typically automatically indexed by the database management system, which helps improve search performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a link or relationship between that table and another table. It creates a logical connection between two tables based on the values stored in the foreign key column(s). Here are some key points about foreign keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Referential integrity: The primary purpose of a foreign key is to enforce referential integrity, ensuring that relationships between tables are maintained correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Relationship establishment: A foreign key in one table refers to the primary key of another table. This relationship defines how the two tables are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data consistency: The foreign key ensures that the values stored in the referencing column(s) of one table exist in the referenced column(s) of the related table. It prevents the creation of \"orphaned\" records.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cascading actions: Foreign keys can be set up to define cascading actions such as cascading updates or deletes. These actions automatically propagate changes in the referenced primary key to the related foreign key values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Multiple relationships: A table can have multiple foreign keys that reference different tables or even the same table. This allows for more complex relationships and database structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key uniquely identifies records within a table, while a foreign key establishes relationships between tables by referring to the primary key of another table. Together, primary keys and foreign keys play a vital role in maintaining data integrity and ensuring the accuracy of relational databases."
